# Predicting-Housing-Prices
My submission for the "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" Kaggle competition.

Although you can look at both the .Rmd and .HTML files to see my analysis, I recommend viewing the .Rmd file. This file contains addition code and comments that are not visible on the .HTML file. Note, you will need a program, such as RStudio that is capable of viewing a .Rmd file.
